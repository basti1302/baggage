## Team Communication

See
[communication](https://github.com/w3c/distributed-tracing-wg#team-communication)

We appreciate feedback and contributions. Please make sure to read
rationale documents when you have a question about particular decision
made in specification.

## Goal

This specification defines propagation of baggage for events correlation
beyond the request identification that is covered by [trace
context](https://w3c.github.io/trace-context/) specification. Our goal
is to share this with the community so that various tracing and
diagnostics products can operate together.
