# Baggage Header Format Rationale

This document provides a rationale for the decisions made for the `Baggage` header format.

## General considerations

- It should be human-readable. Cryptic headers would hide the fact of potential information disclosure.
- It should be append-able (comma-separated) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#page-24 so nodes
can add context properties without parsing existing headers.
- Keys are a single word in ASCII, and values should be a short string in UTF-8 or a derivative of a URL.

## Why a single header?

Another option would be to use prefixed headers, such as `trace-context-X`, where `X` is a propagated
field name. That could reduce the size of the data, particularly in http/2, where header
compression can apply.

Generally speaking, a `Baggage` header may be split into multiple headers, and
compression may be at the same ballpark as repeating values are converted into a single value
in HPAC's dynamic collection. That said, there was no profiling made to make this decision.

The approach with multiple headers has the following problems:
- Name values limitation is much more pressing when the context name is used a part of a header
name.
- The comma-separated format similar to the proposed still needs to be supported in every individual header which makes parsing harder.
- A single header is more comfortable to configure for tracing by many app servers, and makes CORS whitelisting more straightforward.

## Why not Vary-style?

The [Vary](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-7.1.4) approach is another alternative,
where a fixed header is used to enumerate the list of other headers that actually contain the data.
which could be used to accomplish the same. For example, `Baggage: x-department; x-user-id;
ttl=1` could tell the propagation to look at and forward the parent ID header, but only to the
next hop. This has an advantage of HTTP header compression (hpack) and also weave-in with legacy
tracing headers.

Vary approach may be implemented as a new "header reference" value type `ref`.
`Baggage: x-b3-parentid;type=ref;ttl=1` if proven needed.

## Trimming of spaces

The header should be human-readable and editable. Thus spaces are allowed before and after the comma, equal sign, and semicolon separators. It makes manual editing of headers less error-prone. It also allows better visual separation of fields when value modified manually.

## Case sensitivity of keys

There are few considerations why the names should be case sensitive:
- some keys may be a URL query string parameters which are case sensitive
- forcing lower case decreases readability of the names written in camel case

## Value format
While the semantics of header values are specific to the producer and consumer of a key/value pair, we
concluded that string values should be encoded at the producer and decoded at the consumer and that the specification should define a mechanism for that.

URL encoding is a low-overhead way to encode Unicode characters for non-Latin characters in the values. URL encoding keeps a single word in Latin unchanged and accessible.


## Limits

The idea behind limits is to provide trace vendors standard safeguards so the content of the
`Baggage` header can be stored with the request. Thus the limits are defined on the
number of keys, max pair length, and the total size. The total size limit is the most important for planning data storage requirements.

Another consideration was that HTTP cookies provide a similar way to pass custom data via HTTP
headers. So the limits should make the baggage name-value pairs fit the typical
cookie limits.

- *Maximum number of name-value pairs* - this limit was taken as a number of cookies allowed by
Chrome.
- *Maximum number of bytes per a single name-value pair* - the limit allows to store URL as a
value with some extra details as a single context name-value pair. It is also a typical cookie
size limitation.
- *Maximum total length of all name-value pairs* - TODO: LOOKING FOR SUGGESTIONS HERE
