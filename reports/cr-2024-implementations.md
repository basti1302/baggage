During the Candidate Recommendation stage, the Working Group will audit:
* the [OpenTelemetry implementations of Baggage](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/distributions/) to make sure they are following the W3C Baggage spec.
* a sample of [OpenTelemetry's baggage test suites](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/spec-compliance-matrix.md#baggage) to verify they are testing the standard.
